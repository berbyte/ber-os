> The TUI adapter is currently in an experimental state. We recommend using the [GitHub adapter](#github-application-usage) which provides a more stable and feature-complete experience.

1. Set the environment variable

```
export OPENAI_API_KEY=""
```

2. Run the TUI:

```
go run . tui
```

### GitHub Application Usage
0. Create a GitHub App by following our [documentation guide](https://rtfm.ber.run/guides/howto-adapter-github-install/). This will provide you with the required credentials for the next steps.

1. Set the environment variables
```
export GH_APP_ID=""
export GH_PRIVATE_KEY="" # base64 decoded pem
export GH_WEBHOOK_SECRET=""

export OPENAI_API_KEY=""
```

2. Start ngrok:

```
ngrok http http://localhost:8080
```

3. Run the application:
```
go run . webhook --debug
```

For detailed GitHub adapter usage instructions, please visit our [GitHub Adapter Tutorial](https://rtfm.ber.run/tutorials/github/).


### Build Your First Agent
